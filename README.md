# Rustlings ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my personal Rustlings repository! This is where I document my journey of learning Rust, a systems programming language that combines safety, performance, and modern features. Rust has been an exciting and challenging language to dive into, and this repository serves as a collection of my progress, notes, and exercises as I grow my skills.

## My Progress

Progress: [#######################>---------------------------]  45/94

## Why Rust?

I decided to learn Rust because:
- **Memory safety without a garbage collector**: Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures safety at compile time, which is both fascinating and empowering.
- **Performance**: Rust is known for its speed, making it a great choice for systems programming and performance-critical applications.
- **Modern tooling**: `cargo`, Rustâ€™s package manager and build system, is one of the best Iâ€™ve ever used.
- **Community**: The Rust community is welcoming, supportive, and always eager to share knowledge.
## What are Rustlings?

Rustlings are small exercises to help you practice writing Rust code. They range from basic syntax to more advanced concepts, and are designed to be completed in your terminal. Each exercise is a small Rust file with some code that needs to be fixed or completed.

### Highlights of My Learning Experience:
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: One of Rustâ€™s most unique features. It took me some time to wrap my head around it, but now I appreciate how it prevents common bugs like null pointers and data races.
- **Pattern Matching**: Rustâ€™s `match` syntax is incredibly powerful and expressive. It makes handling complex logic much cleaner.
- **Error Handling**: Rustâ€™s `Result` and `Option` types encourage robust and explicit error handling, which Iâ€™ve come to love.
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Rustâ€™s concurrency model is both safe and efficient, making it easier to write parallel code without worrying about data races.

## How Iâ€™m Learning

1. **Rustlings Exercises**: Working through the Rustlings exercises to practice Rust concepts in small, manageable chunks.
2. **Building Small Projects**: Applying what Iâ€™ve learned by building small CLI tools and programs.
3. **Community Engagement**: Participating in Rust forums and Discord channels to ask questions and learn from others.
